# bu1ld

`bu1ld` is an early cross-language build tool prototype.

The first version includes:

- Cobra command layout: `build`, `test`, `graph`, `clean`
- Task discovery via `tasks` and targeted graph planning via `graph [task...]`
- Multi-process `cmd/cli`, `cmd/daemon`, `cmd/server`, and `cmd/lsp` executables
- A small `build.bu1ld` DSL
- A basic DSL language server with parse diagnostics, semantic diagnostics, and schema completions
- A plugin registry with builtin, local, and global plugin sources
- Task graph planning with dependency ordering and cycle detection
- A configuration cache for unchanged build scripts and plugin binaries
- Input fingerprints and a local action cache
- Cached output blobs for declared outputs
- A full `arcgo/dix` runtime per subcommand
- `arcgo/collectionx`, `configx`, `eventx`, and `logx` integration

## DSL

```text
workspace {
  name = "bu1ld"
  default = build
}

plugin go {
  source = builtin
  id = "builtin.go"
}

toolchain go {
  version = $(env("GO_VERSION", "1.26.2"))
}

import "tasks/go.bu1ld"
```

```text
# tasks/go.bu1ld
go.test test {
  packages = ["./..."]
}

go.binary build {
  deps = [test]
  main = "./cmd/cli"
  out = $("dist/" + "bu1ld")
}
```

Block names are typed symbols instead of string labels. The `$(...)` form is
evaluated by `expr-lang/expr`, while the outer build script syntax is parsed
into bu1ld's own AST. Imports are resolved relative to the file that declares
them and also support doublestar glob patterns such as
`import "tasks/**/*.bu1ld"`.

Custom tasks can use the same built-in functions and expression context:

```text
task package {
  outputs = [$("dist/" + target)]
  run {
    shell(concat("echo ", target))
  }
}

task archive {
  deps = [build]
  inputs = ["dist/bu1ld"]
  outputs = [$("dist/" + target + ".tgz")]
  run {
    exec("tar", "-czf", $("dist/" + target + ".tgz"), "dist/bu1ld")
  }
}
```

`shell(...)` actions are parsed as POSIX shell through `mvdan.cc/sh/v3` before
execution. Use `exec(...)` when the task should avoid shell parsing and pass an
argv list directly to the process runner.

Plugins can come from three sources:

```text
plugin go {
  source = builtin
  id = "builtin.go"
}

plugin rust {
  source = local
  id = "org.bu1ld.rust"
  version = "0.1.0"
}

plugin java {
  source = global
  id = "org.bu1ld.java"
  version = "0.1.0"
}
```

Builtin plugins are native Go implementations linked into the bu1ld binary.
Local plugins are external process plugins resolved under the project
`.bu1ld/plugins` directory by default. Global plugins are resolved under the
user home `.bu1ld/plugins` directory by default. A `path = "./..."` value can be
used for local plugin development. External process plugins implement the public
`pkg/pluginapi` protocol and are launched through HashiCorp `go-plugin`. When
the exact install path is missing, local and global plugin resolution falls back
to `go-plugin` discovery under the corresponding plugin directory.

Installed plugins can include a manifest at
`.bu1ld/plugins/<id>/<version>/plugin.json` or
`~/.bu1ld/plugins/<id>/<version>/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "org.bu1ld.rust",
  "namespace": "rust",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "binary": "bu1ld-rust",
  "rules": [{ "name": "binary" }]
}
```

## Usage

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli graph
go run ./cmd/cli graph build
go run ./cmd/cli tasks
go run ./cmd/cli test
go run ./cmd/cli build
go run ./cmd/cli clean
go run ./cmd/cli plugins list
go run ./cmd/cli plugins doctor
go run ./cmd/cli plugins lock
go run ./cmd/daemon status
go run ./cmd/server status
go run ./cmd/lsp stdio
```

`plugins list` prints builtin, declared, and manifest-discovered plugins with
source, namespace, resolved path, rules, and status. `plugins doctor` also
checks the local and global plugin directories and returns a non-zero exit when
a plugin is missing, not executable, has an invalid manifest, or cannot complete
the `go-plugin` handshake.

`plugins lock` writes `bu1ld.lock` with declared plugin source, namespace, id,
version, resolved path, and binary checksum. When `bu1ld.lock` exists,
`plugins doctor` verifies locked plugin paths and checksums.

Project configuration is cached under `.bu1ld/cache/config/project.json`.
`bu1ld` reuses the evaluated task graph when the root build file, imported
files, import glob expansions, environment variables read through `env(...)`,
and external plugin binaries are unchanged. Pass `--no-cache` to bypass both
the configuration cache and build action cache.

Optional config files are loaded through `configx` from `bu1ld.yaml`, `bu1ld.toml`, `bu1ld.json`, or their `.bu1ld.*` variants.

## Test

```bash
go test ./...
```
